## 515. Paint House
#### Given n books and the ith book has A[i] pages. You are given k people to copy the n books.<br>n books list in a row and each person can claim a continous range of the n books. For example one copier can copy the books from ith to jth continously, but he can not copy the 1st book, 2nd book and 4th book (without 3rd book).<br>They start copying books at the same time and they all cost 1 minute to copy 1 page of a book. What's the best strategy to assign books so that the slowest copier can finish at earliest time?

>* Example
>> Given array A = [3,2,4], k = 2.
>> Return 5( First person spends 5 minutes to copy book 1 and book 2 and second person spends 4 minutes to copy book 3. )
