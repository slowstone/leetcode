## 578. Lowest Common Ancestor III
#### Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.<br>The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.<br>Return null if LCA does not exist.<br>node A or node B may not exist in tree.

>* Example
>> For the following binary tree:
```
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
```
>> LCA(3, 5) = 4

>> LCA(5, 6) = 7

>> LCA(6, 7) = 7
