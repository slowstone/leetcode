## 92. Backpack
#### Given n items with size Ai, an integer m denotes the size of a backpack. How full you can fill this backpack?

>* Example
>> If we have 4 items with size [2, 3, 5, 7], the backpack size is 11, we can select [2, 3, 5], so that the max size we can fill this backpack is 10. If the backpack size is 12. we can select [2, 3, 7] so that we can fulfill the backpack.
>> You function should return the max size we can fill in the given backpack.

>* Challenge
>> O(n x m) time and O(m) memory.
>> O(n x m) memory is also acceptable if you do not know how to optimize memory.
