## 101. Symmetric Tree
#### Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

>* Example 1:
>> Input:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
>> Output: true

>* Example 2:
>> Input:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
>> Output: false

>* Note:
>> Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
