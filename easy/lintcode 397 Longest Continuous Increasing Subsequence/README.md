## 397. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
#### Give an integer arrayï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

>* An increasing continuous subsequence:
>>1. Can be from right to left or from left to right.
>>2. Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.

>* Example
>> For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
>> For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.

>* Challenge
>> O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
